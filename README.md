Hello! Ok, so the data for this data_set is taken (and is a slightly modified version of the following dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction

Most data is the same. Your predictor is under the column "satisfaction_satisfied"

0 means unsatisfied
1 means satisfied

Ok, so there's df's created for you in the notebook. The train df includes the predictors and you need to predict on the test_df. You then submit these predictions to the website! It will tell you if you didn't meet the accuracy requirement.

There's a function written to you that takes in both your model AND the test data set. Try and stick with sklearn models instead of deep neural networks. It will then print out your predictions. Copy and paste these into the submission box and hit submit.

Your goal is to submit predictions to the website with at least 95% test accuracy!

Good luck!
